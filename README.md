# House-Pricing
IT IS A DEMO APP THAT PREDICTS A VALUE FOR HOUSE BY TAKING SOME
INFO FROM USER.
Firebase authentication is used for authentication of a user, and firebase
realtime database is used to save user information and get them to display.

# IMPORTANT

You need to set your own firebase SDK, if you want to run the project

# Errors
There are some errors such that calling backstack in the result fragment,
moreover, gross metersquare value is default in prediction model since
there is a problem with taking number input from Edit Text and I cannot fix
it yet.

# Missings
on spinners, I need to set a default "--select--" text at the beginning
on each fragment, then if spinner onItemSelected return "--selected--",
there should be a Toast such as "Please select an item!".

Importantly, I need to add a "Edit" button on Profile fragment in order to
edit your profile info that displays your profile picture and user name.

# Contact
as you see I am new in Android Studio, so there more errors and missings than
stated above. So please inform me for anything about the application
